I need your love,I need your love,You give me light so tonight take me thereI feel your sun start to glow And I know it let me show
That I need your love
I want your touch for the rest of our time together baby
Baby come fly with me eternally
You and me we were meant to be
Yeah hey alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
I see your eyes hold the key
To my paradise summer in your smile
Well it makes me feel so real
You tell me things and my heart
Sings to the world from islands in the sky
Take my hand as one we will stand
You know it's never never to say hello to forever
Yeah hey alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever [x4]
I need your touch
I want your love so much
I need your touch
And I want your love, so much
Oh, now tonight, we'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
